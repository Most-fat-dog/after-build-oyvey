# after-build-oyvey
A clean oyvey for those who want to use a clean oyvey but don't know how to build it.
(If you build src,oyvey is in build<libs<alpha0.0.3release.
I know it's safe because kilab sayd "oyvey is safe" in videos and oyvey has a lot of users.
 However, if something happens to you, I will not take responsibility.)
